%in a particular cell in this embryo at a particular instance of time.

    %sprintf funcion: enforces integers to be formatted in a particular way
    %when converted to a string. Here it enforces the integers to be three

    A=double(A);            %Converts A to a double variable to allow more precise computation

%{

Number of Discrete Unconnected Structures in a cell is a function of time and threshold applied. 
N(threshold,time)
(the lower case names like threshold and time are variables)
(the upper case names like TIME_INJECTION are constants)




As our objective is to study the behaviour of the system over time; we must arrive fix the threshold variable. This slide describes how I have arrived at the threshold that I will be using to study the behaviour of N over time. (and, in any case, there is a range of thresholds for which the behaviour of  N does not change significantly)

I plotted the number of discrete structures as a function of threshold applied at the time point of injection(N(thesholds,TIME_INJECTION) of Rok Inhibitor for the embryos. (Show the plots for a couple of videos for water and rok inhibitor injections). 

The thresholds applied are a percentage of maximum intensity for individual cells. (a 90% threshold means that we are restricting our attention to the cells that have an intensity which is no less than 90% of the maximum intensity found in that particular cell at that particular point in time.

I am trying to be as conservative as I can be while estimating the number of discrete unconnected rok structures. So the threshold that I use is the point of maxima of the function of no. of discrete unconnected structures as a function of time. The reasoning is that if we take the maximum possible number of unconnected number of structures for a particular threshold and we still see an increase in the number of structures at subsequent points in time, our argument seems stronger.
    



area(size filter) : again being conservative here, the typical size of the structuresthat we identify js at least in the 20sq.pixel range i am ignoring thestructures that are 4 sq. pixels large (2pixel by 2pixel). Note: what I amsaying while doing this is that any UNCONNECTED component that is so tinyis ignored(the unconnected components start appearing after theinjection(they actually make the graphs look better, with steeper slopes;but i am ignoring them as noise only to make my the analysis unbiased andconservative.
