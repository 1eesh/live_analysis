%MAIN BODY OF THE CODE

%Here we loop over all time points and then over all the cells at each
%point of time to calculate the number of discrete unconnected structures
%in a particular cell in this embryo at a particular instance of time.

%%LOOP OVER TIME
for time=1:time_number,

    %storing the path of the image as a string, allows us to loop over images using file names differentiated only by the time point label
    image_path=strcat('/Users/eesh/Desktop/live_analysis_data/roki_injection/Image5_011113/Myosin/Image5_011113_t',sprintf('%03d',time),'_z008_c001.tif')  ;  
    %sprintf funcion: enforces integers to be formatted in a particular way
    %when converted to a string. Here it enforces the integers to be three
    %digit integers -> so 3 is '003' and 65 is '065'

    
    
    A=imread(image_path);   %Read the Image from the path
    A_hold=A;               %A_hold holds the image in the uint8 format, use this variable to output images

    A=double(A);            %Converts A to a double variable to allow more precise computation


    %%LOOP OVER CELLS IN THIS EMBRYO AT THIS POINT OF TIME
    for cell_index=1:cell_number, 

        %CHECK IF THE CELL IS TRACKED AT THIS POINT IN TIME
        if(~isnan(datax{time,2,cell_index})) 
        %The isnan check on the EDGE data is just an error check to make
        %sure our computations are done on a cell that is actually tracked
        %at the time point.    
            
            
        %USE THE RESOLUTION TO CONVERT MICRONS TO PIXELS
        tx = datax{time,2,cell_index}'./res;    %Contains the X coordinate of the vertices for this cell at this point in time
        ty = datay{time,2,cell_index}'./res;    %Contains the Y coordinate of the vertices for this cell at this point in time
